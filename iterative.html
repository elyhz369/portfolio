				<h1>ITERATIVE DESIGN: Ole</h1>
				<br />
				<div class="textbox">
					<h2>Designing a prototype for an online shopping start-up.</h2>
					<h2 style="margin-top: 5px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 400;">Skills: #Graphic Design (PS), #UIUX (Figma)</h2>

					<br />
					<p>The process of creating a satisfactory design is often a complex one. At a high level, designers create sketches,
					lofi wireframes, hifi prototypes, and at last a final product. Laid out this way, the process doesn’t seem so bad.
					But with each version comes multiple rounds - iterations - of work. Changes both big and small are fueled by
					feedback from the design team itself and outside users. It is this iteration that is core to design, driving it
					toward a product that is well-tested, well-designed, and well-received. In this project, we sought to familiarize
					ourselves with iterative design by creating an interactive mockup based on an active startup idea.</p><br />
				 	 <p>Ole is a shopping service that allows users to order online without worrying about whether clothes will fit or look
					good on them. Users input their zip code and view clothing items from various stores in the area. Thus, the clothes
					are not limited by brand or store. A personal shopper picks up the items and delivers them at a time that is determined by the user at checkout. While the driver waits, the user can try on each clothing item and select
					which ones to return or keep. The items they wish to return are given back to the driver, who completes the return
					process on the user’s behalf.</p><br/>
				  	<p>Because of the delivery-based nature of the service, we decided to design for a desktop view. We imagine that most
					users will be on their computers when in the comfort of their own homes (or generally indoors), and thus would
					access Ole through those devices.</p><br/><br/>

					<h3>Part I - Sketches</h3><br/>
					<p>We began the process by creating quick sketches of the core pages. The goal here was to explore a breadth of ideas. 
						Here is a set of sketches I created, showing each page & corresponding user's thoughts. 
						</p><br/>
						<div id="image_box">
						<img src="source/Eileen_sketch.png" alt="image' - front" width=100%>
						</div>
						<br/>


						<h3>Part II - Wireframes</h3><br/>
						<p>After reviewing our sketches, we refined our ideas into lofi wireframes. Core design decisions and/or functionalities are noted beneath each wireframe.</p><br/>

						<div id="image_box">
							<div class="wireframe-box">
							  <img src="source/Home.jpg" alt="image' - front" width=100%>
							  <p>A homepage consisting of a welcome message and a brief description of the service. Users can enter their zip
								code to see which stores/clothing items are available nearby. A map at the bottom of the page updates when the
								user enters a valid zip code.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="wireframe-box">
							  <img src="source/Cart.jpg" alt="image' - back" width=100%>
							  <p>A page displaying all the items a user has added to their cart. Basic information about each item (price, quantity, subtotal, size, and color) is displayed. A breakdown of the costs is shown to the right.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="wireframe-box">
							  <img src="source/Checkout.jpg" alt="image' - front" width=100%>
							  <p>A page that allows users to input their information for the order. The Order Summary box still appears to
								remind users of what is generally in their order. They can return to the Cart page if they need more details, or
								would like to edit their order. In a fully developed application, there would be a very similar page for billing
								information.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="wireframe-box">
							  <img src="source/Return.jpg" alt="image' - back" width=100%>
							  <p>This is where users can choose which items to keep and which items to return. It is very similar to the Cart
								page, but has checkboxes in lieu of the trash can icon. Checking the box associated with an item updates the
								Return Summary box.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="wireframe-box">
							  <img src="source/Inspiration.jpg" alt="image' - front" width=100%>
							  <p>A Pinterest-style page that allows users to scroll through various outfits. If they find an outfit they like,
								they can click on it to view the items in the outfit and/or "heart" it. There is also a scrollable side section
								with suggested outfits based on the user's past likes.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="wireframe-box">
							  <img src="source/Inspiration-2.jpg" alt="image' - back" width=100%>
							  <p>If a user clicks on an outfit, they are shown an enlarged image of the outfit, alongside the items in the
								outfit. We debated having an "Add to Cart" button next to each item, but decided against it. To add an item to
								cart, one would have to provide a size, color, and quantity, as well as be aware of the price. This was more
								information than we thought would be wise to display. We decided it would be best to separate this functionality
								and simply allow the user to navigate to an item's page by clicking on the image of it.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="wireframe-box">
							  <img src="source/Order-Confirmation.jpg" alt="image' - front" width=100%>
							  <p>A simple order confirmation screen that lets the user know their purchase was successful. The button in the
								middle of the screen takes the user to the next step in the process: choosing which items to return and accept.
							  </p>
							</div>
							<div class="wireframe-box">
							  <img src="source/Shipping Confirmation Page.png" alt="image' - back" width=100%>
							  <p>A page where people can choose what time they want their personal shopper to arrive with their items, as well as which shipping method they prefer. A map displays the address that the user previously inputted.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="wireframe-box">
							  <img src="source/Item_Page_Updated.png" alt="image' - back" width=100%>
							  <p>The page for each item, where items' details are displayed and can be customized.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="wireframe-box">
							  <img src="source/Return-Confirmation.jpg" alt="image' - back" width=100%>
							  <p>A simple confirmation screen that lets the user know their transaction was successful. The button in the middle
								of the screen takes the user back to the Shop page in case they want to follow up on their order.</p>
							</div>
						  </div>
						  <br/>
						

						  <h3>Part III - Prototype</h3><br/>
						  <p>Below is a preview of a page in our hifi prototype, created based on our lofi wireframes and the feedback we received during a critique session with peers.</p><br/>
							<div id="image_box">
								<img src="source/prototype.png" alt="image' - front" width=100%>
							</div>
							
							<h6>Critique Feedback</h6><br/>
							<div class="list">
								<ol>
								<li>
									<h5>Overall & Miscellaneous</h5>
									<ul>
									<li>Keep the same padding and margin across all pages. The buttons involved in the checkout process appear to
										be in slightly different positions on different pages.</li>
									<li>Keep the rounding of boxes and images consistent.</li>
									<li>The navigation bar is not fully functional on all pages. Fixing this will help emulate the actual
										experience of using the site more accurately.</li>
									<li>The navigation bar in particular is a bit "jumpy" between pages.</li>
									<li>A wishlist page might be helpful as a way to store liked items.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<br/>
								<li>
									<h5>Browsing (Shopping) Page</h5>
									<ul>
									<li>Placing filters at the top or left feels more intuitive.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<br/>
								<li>
									<h5>Item Page</h5>
									<ul>
									<li>Add a description for each item.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<br/>
								<li>
									<h5>Checkout Page</h5>
									<ul>
									<li>Users cannot go back to the previous page while checking out, which is commonly supported and expected
										functionality.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<br/>
								<li>
									<h5>Shipping/Time Confirmation Page</h5>
									<ul>
									<li>Consider offering ranges instead of specific times.</li>
									<li>Strengthen the hierarchy. At the moment, numerous elements appear to be at the same level of hierarchy
										when it seems like there should be an order.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<br/>
								<li>
									<h5>Order Confirmation Page</h5>
									<ul>
									<li>Show a summary of the items that were ordered.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								</ol>
							</div>
							<br/>

							<div class="list">
								<h6>Revised Prototype</h6><br/>
								<p>Based on other feedback from critique, we improved our prototype in several ways:
								<ul>
								  <li>Added the ability to go back to previous steps in the checkout process.
								  <li>Standardized rounding and positioning of elements. In particular, the Summary sections and checkout-related
									buttons are now all positioned in the same location.
								  <li>The navbar is functional on all pages.
								  <li>Added a wishlist page.
								  <li>Altered the location of the filters on the Browse page.
								  <li>Added a description for each clothing item.
								  <li>Redesigned the Shipping/Time Confirmation page so that it has a clearer, more intuitive hierarchy. In
									particular, text sizes are more clearly different. The page also offers time ranges instead of concrete times.
								</ul>
